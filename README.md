Here I have list down the main part we have done during the project timeline.
### Software
- Implement a eye detection methods using  **python**.
- tested using the raspberry pi 3B+ and rasberry pi Nano zero W.

### Hardware
- Design a 3D model to the proposed prototype.
- choose the component according to the hardware design
